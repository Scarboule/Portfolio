# Hi guys, This is my portfolio.
### This project is not finished
### This frontend project has been made during my second year studying web developpement at school. 

You can see it buy clicking [here](https://portfolio-scarboule.vercel.app/)  
or you can download it with [this one](https://github.com/Scarboule/Portfolio/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)  
  
this project use sass and fontawesome.  
if you want to modify it, don't forget to download sass and use the command ```sass --watch style.sass build.css``` in the project directory.
### Deployment
This website has been first deployed using Github pages. 
Then i've began to use Vecel.
By creating an account on Vercel, linked with Github and enable it on this repository.
It Automaticly deploy the main branch with new and customisable domains names.
Vercel automatically handles the configuration of the build settings for my framework. Vercel also provides build logs, to help me to identify issues before i deploy to production.
I can now use Checkly, Analytics, and Usage to monitor how well my site is performing.
I've also added and enabled "imgbot" and "AccessLint" to this repository.  
imgbot has reduced the loading time of my project by 40%~ compressing my images files.
AccessLint helps me identify accessibility issue in my code.  
Thoses to are automaticly doing merge request fixing and identifying my issues.
